# BettingBot
Developed a Python-based sports betting tool, that retrieves and processes live odds data from various sportsbooks using the Odds API. The program calculates the expected value for different sports events, identifying potential profitable betting opportunities, and sends notifications through a Discord bot to automatically post the most profitable opportunities.
Used Json collected, and Pandas to convert odds into implied probabilities. Made a custom algorithm to compare sportsbook odds with Pinnacle's odd) to calculate expected EV for each event, including recommended units.
